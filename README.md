# Modern Algebra with Friends

This repository contains the LaTeX source files for *Modern Algebra With Friends*. The text is inspired by Dr. Katherine Magurn's Fall 2012 MATH 421 course at Miami University in Oxford, OH. In this work, we attempt to preserve her unique ability to make dense material accessible to all learners, so that others may bask in the warm light she brought to learning mathematics.

## About the Text

The book provides:
1. **Tools for Proof Construction**: Learn to generate and verify formal arguments about mathematical structures.
2. **Primer on Modern Algebra**: An accessible introduction to group theory, ring theory, field theory, and more, making advanced topics like Category Theory more approachable.

### Recommended for:
- Undergraduates with an Algebra II background.
- Motivated high school students with similar preparation.
- Readers seeking an introduction to Abstract Algebra as a foundation for further study in mathematics.

## 🧭 Structure of the Book (So Far!)

### **Part I – Foundations of Modern Algebra**
**Chapter 0 – Preliminaries**  
Common notation, proof strategies (contrapositive, contradiction, induction), and set-theoretic foundations.

**Chapter 1 – Relations, Mappings, and the Integers  (ℤ)**  
Equivalence relations, functions and mappings, divisibility, greatest common divisors, and modular arithmetic.

**Chapter 2 – Group Theory**  
From definitions and examples to subgroups, normal subgroups, homomorphisms, Cayley’s Theorem, permutation groups, Sylow theorems, and direct products.

**Chapter 3 – Ring Theory**  
Covers ring structures, ideals, quotient rings, ring homomorphisms, fields of fractions, Euclidean rings, and polynomial rings. Includes discussions on principal ideal domains and related problems.

---

### **Part II – Homework, Exams, and Solutions**
Contains complete **homework sets**, **course exams**, and detailed **solutions** to selected problems.  
Designed for both **self-assessment** and **instructor use**.

---

### **Part III – Logic Primer**
A self-contained reference on **propositional** and **first-order logic**, including:
- Introduction and elimination rules for all logical connectives.
- Quantifier rules with scope management.
- Identity and equality rules.
- Derived rules (modus tollens, disjunctive syllogism, etc.).
- Classical vs. Intuitionistic logic.
- Second-order logic, comprehension, and related exercises.

This section doubles as a **mini-course in formal reasoning**, complete with practice problems and solutions.

### **Appendices & Supplementary Material**
- **Brief Primer on Matrix Multiplication**
- **Homework and Exam Solutions**
- **Bibliography and References**
- **Index**
