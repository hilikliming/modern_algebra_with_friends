# Modern Algebra With Friends

This repository contains the LaTeX source files for *Modern Algebra With Friends*. The text is inspired by the Fall 2012 MATH 421 course at Miami University in Oxford, OH, taught by Dr. Katherine Magurn. In this work we attempt to distill and reflect her unique ability to make dense material accessible to all learners.

## About the Text

The book provides:
1. **Tools for Proof Construction**: Learn to generate and verify formal arguments about mathematical structures.
2. **Primer on Modern Algebra**: An accessible introduction to group theory, ring theory, field theory, and more, making advanced topics like Category Theory more approachable.

### Recommended for:
- Undergraduates with an Algebra II background.
- Motivated high school students with similar preparation.
- Readers seeking an introduction to Abstract Algebra as a foundation for further study in mathematics.

### Suggested Next Steps:
For those pursuing Category Theory, consider Steven Roman's *"An Introduction to the Language of Category Theory"* after completing this book.
