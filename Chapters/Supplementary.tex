\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://linear.axler.net/LADR4e.pdf}{Dr. Sheldon Axler's \textit{Linear Algebra Done Right (4$^{th}$ Ed.)} (Excellent text that you are well-equipped to now read!)} \\ \\
    \item \href{https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCTMeyjMKRkoS699U0OJ3ymr3r01sI08l}{Dr. Richard Southwell's Videos on Intro to Category Theory (WONDERFUL RESOURCE!)} \\ \\
    \item \href{https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCTMeyjMKRkqTM2-9HXH81tvpdROs-nz3}{Dr. Southwell's Modern Foundations of Mathematics} \\ \\
    \item \href{https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbgaMIhjbmEnaH_LTkxLI7FMa2HsnawM_}{Dr. Bartosz Milewski's Intro to Category Theory for Programmers} \\ \\
    \item \href{https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW3u28VuDAHJNrf3JCgT0GG_rjFVz0-j9}{Dr. Aviv Censor's lectures on Algebra (Algebra 1M at Technion University)} \\ \\
    \item \href{https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage}{ nLab -- a wiki for collaborative work on Mathematics, Physics and Philosophy â€” especially, but far from exclusively, from the n-point of view: with a sympathy towards the tools and perspective of category theory and higher category theory.} \\ \\
    \item \href{https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1-2D_rCQBarjdqnM21sOsx09CtFSVO6Z}{Dr. Robert Harper's Lectures on Homotopy Type Theory (dense but great so far!)} \\ \\
    \item \href{https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhgq-BqyZ7i6IjU82EDzCqgERKjjIPlmh}{David Spivak and Nelson Niu's Course on Polynomial Functors (again kind of dense but extremely interesting, make sure you remember some basic Categorical defns before starting this or the one above, they come out the gate swinging, using Products and Co-Products and they assume you already know these)} \\ \\
    \item \href{https://realnotcomplex.com}{"Real not Complex" is a wonderful resource of freely available Math Texts in a Variety of subjects}\\ \\
    \item \href{https://github.com/bgavran/Category_Theory_Machine_Learning}{Bruno Gavranovi\'{c} has compiled a nice list of reading materials concerned with Category Theoretic Approaches to Machine Learning}\\ 
\end{itemize}
